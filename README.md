# C++ Off-by-One Error in Vector Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a `std::vector`.  The code attempts to access an element beyond the valid index range of the vector, leading to undefined behavior.  The solution shows the corrected code with proper bounds checking.
